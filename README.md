# unity-delete-script-bug
To prove deleting a file on batchmode build causes compilation problems.

This has been tested using Unity 5.0.0f4 .. but I'm told it affects other versions of Unity 5 as well.

Initial project setup was done with basic new project, single folder, couple scripts, nothing fancy.
The project is set to "Visible Meta Files" for Version Control Mode; and "Force Text" for Serialization.
The build scripts were created for full blown projects, based on online docs and general needs.
